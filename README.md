# RedmiBudsBar

A macOS menu bar app for Xiaomi **REDMI Buds** earbuds. It shows battery levels (left, right, case), switches
the noise mode, and exposes the settings your model supports: equalizer presets, custom equalizer curves,
gestures, find my earbuds and more. It lives only in the menu bar (no Dock icon).

## Supported models

Capabilities per model are ported from [Gadgetbridge](https://codeberg.org/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge)'s
REDMI Buds support. The app only shows the controls a model supports. Unknown "Redmi Buds ..." names fall back
to a minimal set (battery and noise mode).

| Model | Status |
| --- | --- |
| REDMI Buds 8 | Tested on hardware |
| REDMI Buds 8 Active | Untested (protocol shared with Gadgetbridge) |
| REDMI Buds 8 Pro | Untested (not in Gadgetbridge; assumed Buds 8 + adaptive ANC) |
| Redmi Buds 6 Pro | Untested (protocol shared with Gadgetbridge) |
| Redmi Buds 6 | Untested (protocol shared with Gadgetbridge) |
| Redmi Buds 6 Active | Untested (protocol shared with Gadgetbridge) |
| Redmi Buds 6 Lite | Untested (protocol shared with Gadgetbridge) |
| Redmi Buds 5 Pro | Untested (protocol shared with Gadgetbridge) |
| Redmi Buds 4 Active | Untested (protocol shared with Gadgetbridge) |
| Redmi Buds 3 Pro | Untested (protocol shared with Gadgetbridge) |
| Other "Redmi Buds ..." | Generic fallback, untested |

REDMI Buds 8 is modelled as the Buds 8 Active capability set plus noise control, which was confirmed on hardware.
REDMI Buds 8 Pro is assumed to be the Buds 8 set plus the adaptive noise cancelling toggle; this is a guess.
Unlike the other models it is controlled over the Serial Port channel (usually 28) without the authentication
handshake: its "MIWEAR" channel does not answer the challenge.
It also offers an experimental spatial audio switch (Off / Dolby Audio / Immersive, config `0x1D`). Its values
come from a third-party Buds 8 Pro capture and are unverified; the raw value reported by the earbuds is logged.
If you test another model, please open an issue with the result.

## Features

- Battery rings for left, right and case, with a charging indicator
- Noise mode (Off / Noise cancelling / Transparency) and level, where the model supports it
- Equalizer: the model's firmware presets, plus app-defined custom curves (Bass Boost+, ASMR, Vocal clarity,
  Night) on models with a custom equalizer
- Find my earbuds (left / right), wearing detection and other toggles the earbuds report
- Gesture configuration (tap actions, long-press cycle)
- English / Spanish / System language, switchable live
- Optional low battery notification (below 15%)
- Launch at login (enabled on first run)
- A device picker in Settings when several REDMI Buds are paired

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or later, Apple Silicon or Intel (releases are universal binaries)
- The earbuds must be paired with the Mac **and connected** to it

## Install from Releases

1. Download `RedmiBudsBar-<version>.zip` from the Releases page and unzip it.
2. Move `RedmiBudsBar.app` to `/Applications`.
3. The app is ad-hoc signed, not notarized, so Gatekeeper blocks the first launch. Either right-click the app
   and choose **Open**, or run:

   ```sh
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/RedmiBudsBar.app
   ```
4. Allow Bluetooth access when macOS asks.

## Build from source

Requires Xcode / the Swift 6 toolchain.

```sh
swift build
swift test
./scripts/build-app.sh          # universal app in build/, installed to ~/Applications
./scripts/package-release.sh    # dist/RedmiBudsBar-<version>.zip
```

The version comes from the `VERSION` file. `build-app.sh` writes it into `Info.plist`.

## How it works

- The earbuds expose a control channel as an RFCOMM service named **"miwear"** (custom UUID
  `df21fe2c-2515-4fdb-8886-f12c4d67927c`). The app finds the channel through SDP and falls back to channel 28.
- Frames look like `FE DC BA | type | opcode | length (2 bytes, big endian) | [status] | seq | payload | EF`.
  Types: `C4` phone request, `04` response, `C0` earbuds request, `C7` earbuds notification. Several frames can
  arrive in one read, so the decoder is a streaming parser.
- On connect the phone and the earbuds authenticate each other with a challenge/response based on a SAFER+
  variant (opcode `0x50`/`0x51`). The app then requests device info, run info and configuration.
- `Sources/BudsProtocol` is pure Swift (frame codec, authentication, parsers, command builders, model
  capabilities). `Sources/RedmiBudsBar` contains the IOBluetooth transport, view model and SwiftUI views.
  Tests use frames captured from a real REDMI Buds 8 as fixtures.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing happens / "Disconnected":** the earbuds must be connected to the Mac (for example as the audio
  output). Use the refresh button in the panel to reconnect.
- **Bluetooth permission:** if you denied it, enable RedmiBudsBar under System Settings > Privacy & Security >
  Bluetooth, then relaunch.
- **Logs:**

  ```sh
  log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "io.github.redmibudsbar.RedmiBudsBar"' --level debug
  ```

  Frames the app does not understand are logged as hex; please include them in bug reports.

## Why there is no iOS version

The control channel is classic Bluetooth RFCOMM. On iOS, third-party apps can only use RFCOMM with accessories
that are part of Apple's MFi program, so this protocol is not reachable from an iOS app.

## Español

RedmiBudsBar es una app de la barra de menús de macOS para auriculares Xiaomi **REDMI Buds**. Muestra la
batería (izquierdo, derecho y estuche), cambia el modo de ruido y permite ajustar el ecualizador, los gestos y
la función de buscar auriculares, según lo que soporte cada modelo. Solo se ha probado en dispositivos reales
con REDMI Buds 8; los demás modelos usan el mismo protocolo que Gadgetbridge pero no se han probado.

- **Requisitos:** macOS 14 o superior (Apple Silicon o Intel); los auriculares deben estar vinculados y
  conectados al Mac.
- **Instalación:** descarga el `.zip` desde Releases, muévelo a `/Applications` y, como la app tiene firma
  ad hoc, abre con clic derecho > **Abrir** o ejecuta
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/RedmiBudsBar.app`.
- **Idioma:** English, Español o el del sistema, desde Ajustes dentro del panel.
- **Licencia:** AGPL-3.0-or-later. Proyecto no oficial, sin relación con Xiaomi.
